## An hydro-morphological analysis of erosion processes along the south-west french coastline.

[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/env-models/Beach_erosion/blob/master/Storm%20Impact%20Indicator_2.ipynb)

As the storm induced erosion processes are still a research topic, this analysis aims at understanding how the storm energy variable (based on wave heigh and storm duration) could correlate with volumes of eroded beach. Taking as an input 5 years of hydroclimatic model data as well as 162 ground surveys done in Truc Vert (France), this work was designed as a basic model before an early warning system could be implemented localy.
